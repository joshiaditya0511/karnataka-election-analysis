      <p class="section-intro">Karnataka's recent state assembly elections reveal shifting political patterns over the past decade. The results from 2013, 2018, and 2023 trace a path from decisive outcomes to nuanced shifts in vote share and constituency wins — reflecting how electoral dynamics evolve over time.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
              Overall, the data indicates a strong consolidation of votes in favor of the INC, leading to their majority in the assembly.

                Bharat Jodo Yatra was a mass movement which was held by the political party Indian National Congress ("the Congress" or INC as short form). Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was orchestrating the movement by encouraging the party cadre and the public to walk from Kanyakumari at the southern tip of India to the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, a journey of 4,080 kilometres (2,540 miles) over almost 150 days.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">
                According to INC, the movement was intended to unite the country against the "divisive politics" of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Government of India. The Bharat Jodo Yatra movement was launched by Rahul Gandhi and Tamil Nadu chief minister M. K. Stalin; on September 7, 2022.

            The Bharat Jodo Yatra (BJY), led by Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party, covered 21 assembly constituencies in Karnataka. The Yatra spanned 511km in Karnataka over 22 days, moving from Gundlupet constituency to Raichur Rural constituency.
            <br><br>
            The map shows that the Yatra went through constituencies that the INC didn't win much in 2018. Out of 21 constituencies, the INC won in only 5, while the BJP won in 12 and the JD(S) in 4. But in 2023, things changed. The INC won in 15 of these constituencies and joined forces with SKP in Melukote, making their total 16.

          <p>
            If we look at the charts, we see that constituencies visited by the BJY had almost the same vote share as other constituencies. This may imply that the Yatra wasn't all that beneficial for INC. But if we compare this to the last election, there's a big change. The vote share in constituencies visited by BJY went up a lot (by about 9.78%) from 2018 to 2023. In other constituencies, it went up too, but only by about 5.80%.
            <br><br>
            So, what does this mean? It looks like the Bharat Jodo Yatra made a difference. It seems to have helped the INC do better in the places it visited, especially since they didn't do well there in 2018.
            <br><br>
            While the Yatra is seen as a factor in the improved performance, it's essential to note that correlation doesn't imply causation, and other factors might have contributed to the results.

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            Over the past three assembly elections, there's been a noticeable shift in the political landscape. The data reveals a continuous rise in the combined vote share of the two leading national parties, BJP and INC. As depicted in the graph, their collective vote share has consistently increased over the years.
            <br><br>
            But what does this mean for regional parties and their candidates?
            <br><br>
            As the national parties grow stronger, regional parties are facing a decline in their vote share. This trend might raise questions for voters who support local parties. If the trajectory continues, will their preferred regional party have the influence and representation they once had?
            <br><br>
            Moreover, candidates from these regional parties might find themselves at a crossroads. A dwindling vote share could mean reduced chances of electoral success, prompting them to reconsider their affiliations.
            <br><br>
            In essence, the rising dominance of national parties could reshape the political fabric, nudging voters and candidates to reevaluate their loyalties. As we move forward, it will be intriguing to see how this dynamic evolves and impacts the broader political spectrum.

        <p>
          The concept of the Effective Number of Parties (ENP) is used to measure the number of "effective" parties in a political system. It's not just a count of total parties; rather, it's a weighted measure that takes into consideration the relative strength of each party.
          <br><br>
          In a two-party system, the ENP will be close to 2, while in a system with many small parties, the ENP will be much higher.

      <h2 class="section-heading">The Paradox of Participation</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">While earlier we observed that the two major national parties, BJP and INC, have been gaining a larger share of the votes—pointing towards a consolidation of power—there's another aspect of the elections that's worth exploring.</p>
      <div class="row align-items-center mb-4">
        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="increasing-number-of-contesting-parties">Increasing Number of Contesting Parties</h3>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            Over the past three elections, the number of political parties contesting in Karnataka has notably increased. In 2013, there were 59 parties on the ballot. This number jumped to 91 in 2018 and remained consistent in 2023. At first glance, this seems paradoxical. If the BJP and INC are dominating the vote share, why are more parties choosing to enter the electoral race?
            <br><br>
            As a data scientist and not a political analyst, I can only offer my observations. Despite the dominance of the two major parties, the rise in the number of contesting parties might suggest that various groups are still eager to have their voices heard. This increase could reflect emerging local issues, regional aspirations, or new political movements aiming to influence the political discourse. It highlights that our democracy remains vibrant and dynamic, with multiple parties contributing to a diverse political landscape.

            Conversely, the number of independent candidates has been steadily decreasing over the same period. While more parties are entering the fray, fewer individuals are choosing to run without party affiliation. From my perspective as a data scientist, this might indicate that candidates see greater value in aligning with an established party, even if it's a smaller one, rather than going it alone. This could be due to the support and resources that parties provide, making it challenging for independents to compete on their own. Ultimately, this trend suggests that parties are becoming the main avenue for political participation, with individuals preferring to be part of a collective rather than stand alone.

      <h2 class="section-heading">Party Turnover and Swing Direction</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Every election cycle, a number of constituencies change their political color as seats move from one party to another, a phenomenon often described as “party turnover” or “swing direction.” These shifts offer valuable insights into voter sentiment, anti-incumbency trends, and the evolving balance of power on the state's electoral map.</p>
      <div class="row align-items-center mb-4">
        <div class="col-md-5">
          <div class="table-container" id="party-turnover-swing-direction-13-to-18">

        <div class="col-md-7">
          <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="a-cycle-of-major-party-swings">A Cycle of Major Party Swings</h3>
          <p>
            Between 2013 and 2018, a clear pattern emerged: the biggest shift was from the INC to the BJP, involving 58 constituencies. This dramatic turnover helped the BJP recover from its previous defeat and placed it in a stronger position by 2018. However, by the 2023 election, the direction of movement reversed, with 41 constituencies moving from the BJP to the INC. These swings suggest a repetitive cycle where the party in power often faces a strong wave of anti-incumbency, losing its advantage to the other main national player in the next election.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="two-party-axis-at-the-core">The Two-Party Axis at the Core</h3>
          <p>
            Although JD(S) and a group of “Others” (smaller parties and independents) exist, most significant turnovers occur between the two national parties: the INC and the BJP. For instance, while JD(S) and Others occasionally gain seats, the big story across both election cycles has been the back-and-forth exchange of constituencies between INC and BJP. This pattern shows that Karnataka's political battlefield, at its heart, is shaped like a tug-of-war between these two main contenders.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row align-items-center mb-4">
        <div class="col-md-7">
          <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="jds-caught-in-the-crossfire">JD(S) Caught in the Crossfire</h3>
          <p>
            JD(S) consistently experiences a mix of gains and losses but struggles to break the cycle of losing more ground than it holds onto. Between 2013 and 2018, it both lost and gained seats to and from the INC and BJP, ending up more as a swing player than a stable force. A similar churn continued between 2018 and 2023, with JD(S) again conceding seats to both major parties. Rather than emerging as a solid third front, JD(S) remains on shifting sands, vulnerable to the intense competition between INC and BJP.
          </p>
          <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="diminishing-others-and-the-impact-of-distribution">Diminishing “Others” and the Impact of Distribution</h3>
          <p>
            In the earlier cycle (2013-2018), smaller parties and independents surrendered several seats to the main trio. By 2018-2023, these “Others” became nearly irrelevant, losing or gaining very few constituencies. Coupled with the first-past-the-post system, the result is that even a modest lead in vote share for the leading party can translate into disproportionately large seat gains. As a result, focused campaigning and strategic concentration of votes play a major role in producing big swings, and the entire landscape now appears locked in a dynamic, two-party-dominated struggle.

        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="battleground-constituencies">Battleground Constituencies: A Close Look at Three Election Cycles</h3>
        <p>
          In every election, certain constituencies emerge as battlegrounds—places where the competition is fierce and the outcomes are decided by razor-thin margins. For this analysis, we classified constituencies as "battlegrounds" if the winning margin was less than 5% in all three consecutive assembly elections (2013, 2018, and 2023). This criterion highlights areas where voters are deeply divided, and every vote carries significant weight.
          <br><br>
          Using this definition, six constituencies—Bailhongal, Haliyal, Hosakote, Sringeri, Tumkur City, and Tumkur Rural—stand out. Here's what the data reveals about these consistently close contests:

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-7">
          <p>
            <b>Persistent Tight Races:</b>
            Each of these constituencies has witnessed remarkably close contests over three election cycles. The winning margin has consistently remained under 5%, signaling a near-even split in voter preferences. This pattern underlines how these constituencies remain unpredictable and fiercely competitive.

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p>
            <b>Switching Parties Doesn't Always Switch Fortunes:</b> In some constituencies, candidates attempted to change their political fortunes by switching parties, but the results remained unchanged. For example:
          </p>
          <p>
            In Bailhongal, Jagadish C. Metgud ran as a BJP candidate in 2013, as an Independent in 2018, and returned to BJP in 2023. Yet, in all three elections, he ended up as the runner-up.

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p>
            Similarly, in Haliyal, Sunil Hegade moved from JD(S) to BJP over the years but remained in second place in all three contests.

        <div class="col-md-5">
          <p>
            <b>Party Loyalty Over Candidate Loyalty in Hosakote:</b> The case of Hosakote offers a unique insight into voter behavior. Here, N Nagaraju won elections in 2013 and 2018 as a Congress (INC) candidate, defeating BJP-backed opponents. By 2023, both Nagaraju and his main opponent, Sharath Kumar Bachegowda, had switched parties—Nagaraju moved to BJP, and Bachegowda to INC. Despite this, INC retained the seat with Bachegowda now representing the party. 
            <br><br>
            This outcome hints that voters in Hosakote may prioritize party loyalty over individual candidates, favoring the party symbol that previously won over the personality behind it.

        <ul class="planned-features-list">
          <li><strong>Party Constituency Cluster Analysis:</strong> Explore geographic clusters of constituencies voting for the same party, uncovering any spatial patterns in party popularity.</li>
          <li><strong>Swing Constituency Analysis:</strong> Identify constituencies with fluctuating party preferences, providing insights into areas with unpredictable voting patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Investigating the NOTA Option:</strong> A deeper dive into NOTA votes to understand where and why voters might choose this option in significant numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrating Census Data for More Depth:</strong> Adding more layers of analysis using census data on aspects like: <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Average family income levels and economic demographics</li>
              <li>Population aggregates by caste, religion, age groups, and gender</li>
              <li>Educational attainment levels across different demographics</li>
              <li>Employment and occupation types across regions</li>
              <li>Urban versus rural migration patterns and density</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, the 2011 census data is outdated, as factors like migration, urbanization, and constituency changes have significantly altered demographics, making it less reliable for this analysis.</p>
